						<p>Our web app is the go for all things NBA statistics. It is able to look through information and analytics of every player in the NBA both active and all-time. It is able to give users information of upcoming, past, and present games with information on where the game will be played. It is able to compare two players of the NBA and compare analytics between them.</p>
						<p>Our web app as a whole adheres to HCI design principles because HCI is all about understanding the connection between humans and technology. We know that there are users who are massive basketball fans who would love to have a clean experience interacting with an NBA web application. However, they have been stuck with the same websites which have not been updated aesthetically which is important as noted throughout the course. This is where our web app comes into play. We designed it in such a way in which the user can feel as if they are in total control of the information they are gathering. They are able to do this by using the pandas library as our main data display method. The pandas library is able to allow the user to receive clean cut raw data of their favorite players.</p>

                        <p>A Team effort to create a Data Driven statistics web application, with user expierence at the forefront of development</p>
						<p>The main purpose for the creation of this web application was simply because it was a desire for many of our group members to see. Especially with playoff time coming in this year’s NBA season, it made us motivated to get this up and running for playoff time. Something many future users can agree on is that when engaging in any basketball conversations, players will be compared and even investigated by fans. Basketball lovers enjoy looking through past and present players and looking through their statistics and especially in playoff time. Many people who make playoff predictions like comparing analytics of the top performers in each team which is one of the perfect uses for our web application.</p>

										</div>
										<p>Our main goal going into this was effectiveness. We wanted to make sure a user could see the statistics perfectly for each player and we wanted to make sure the API we were using to transfer these statistics was reliable and had all accurate NBA statistics. After comparing official NBA websites with analytics, we were able to ensure complete effectiveness in our web app. It is important to note how we also placed emphasis on the speed in which the user can look and filter through players. By implementing little things such as an autofill search and “active/all-time” filters, we want to make sure the user accesses this information in a fast manner.</p>
										<p>Another main usability goal we established was efficiency. We know there are multiple NBA statistic pages such as Basketball Reference, but we know that pages like the one mentioned might not be as efficient as ours. Our web app was able to use streamlit to condense everything and make it streamlined for the average user. If someone goes to Basketball Reference, they are greeted by an immense amount of information which can actually deter a user from accessing the information provided by the site. We wanted to make sure that data will show up with what the user would like to see. There is no extraneous data which distracts the user from what they are there for in the first place.</p>

										<h2>Designing</h2>

										</div>
										<p>The design process as a whole for this web app came very fluid for the most part. As most of us are pretty knowledgeable with the essentials of basketball, we had a lot in common and we took it to the design board. We started off with a simple drop down select box where all basketball players who have ever played in the NBA would show up. While this was nowhere near what we ended up doing, it was important to get a heads-up look at what the Streamlit framework and NBA statistics would look like. The statistics as a whole did not take as long as we thought and the stadium and game information came as a great plus. The design was simple especially with utilizing the basic essentials of streamlit. From select boxes to radios, we had a great time implementing what we were familiar with in our Human Computer Interaction Course. This made the whole design process only have minimal setbacks.</p>

										<h2>Implementation</h2>

										</div>
										<p>The API integration process as a whole for this web app was nothing short of simple. While the idea of finding the right API is simple, actually putting it into motion was a different story. Firstly, it was important to look through various API’s and see which one had the best free plan with the best ratio of requests per minute. Luckily after just a while, we came across the perfect one. Aside from this minor setback, we were able to get the ball rolling and everything else came naturally.</p>
										<p>As mentioned previously, the interactive widgets we used such as radios and select boxes were crucial for the usability goals talked about earlier. The efficiency aspect of our web app was something we always wanted to prioritize as we know other websites simply don’t place this concept as important as us. These interactive widgets help make all the information we present become concise and just what the user would like to see. The radio was important to determine whether the user would like to see all time or active NBA players. This was a massive upgrade to just listing out all players who have played in the league which could have simply been too much on the user.</p>

										<h2>User Testing</h2>

										</div>
										<p>we received some praise but slight constructive criticism from one of our users who claimed they wanted a way in which the whole web app was not just a single page and could extend through more Streamlit pages. This led our group into the dark ages of sorts in terms of starting back from scratch to see where we could implement different pages. Streamlit functions in a way where most of the web application is seen on one long page. However, our users would get tired of scrolling up and down for extended periods of time. We took this problem head on and were able to get through some workarounds which were able to improve our web app.</p>

                                    <p>As a whole, the experience of creating a web application for the NBA seemed to be a dream come true for some of us. As basketball fans, we all had some motivation to continue and listen to the feedback from the usability tests. As developers, this experience as a whole helped teach us the true impact that feedback has on a project. The scrolling issue was not something none of us had really thought of until our users pointed it out during the testing. It was thanks to the users who participated in the testing that our web app was able to improve. This lesson will help us on our potential future improvements as listening to our users through testing can help us to create a product they will love even more.</p>
