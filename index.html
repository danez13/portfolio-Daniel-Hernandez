								&emsp;Hello, I am Daniel Hernandez. I am a Cuban-American student at Florida International University. I was born in Cuba, but at the ripe young age of one my family legally immigrated to the United States, with their hearts dead set on working for a better future. Even with our low income, at a young age I gravitated towards technology, but not quite in the sense of just watching youtube and surfing the internet as some other kids my age were. 
							</p>
							<p class="style1"> &emsp;When my family bought a home computer, one meant for me to use for school and for them to pay bills, I soon would spend countless hours going through the settings and testing every single setting I could. I still remember my dad being mad because the computer would be unusable at times afterwards. As I grew older my family would buy me my own personal laptop, once again, meant for me to use for school. Roughly half a year later, after one of the ports would stop working, my family would find me elbows deep into the laptop, disconnecting the storage drives and ram trying to get to the motherboard to find out the ports had to be resoldered. </p>
							<p class="style1"> &emsp; Although the same passion for a better future that my family had when we first arrived to the United States never left us. When I started university at FIU and continuing to this day I would get a job, working mainly in retail and warehouses. While working I learned intangible skills like teamwork, work organization, time management, and client services. Oftentimes being given tasks that were time sensitive, required consistent management, awareness to detail, and teamwork in order to be completed. Furthermore, I learned client services in retail, being able to address client concerns, inquiries, and anger while providing proper, pleasant, and effective client experiences. </p>
							<p class="style1"> &emsp;Now as an adult I've grown an interest in math and computer science, finding the same playful and headaching frustrating love I did as a kid with my laptop, in finding ways to implement algorithms and/or a feature and in finding underlying statistics in large amounts of data. Over the years I have done a variety of projects, and continue doing more as my skills as a programmer progresses. I know a variety of programming languages: html/css, javascript, java, python, and C. among these I am mostly comfortable with python, java, and C, even using python libraries likes pandas, numpy, and matplotlib in some of my projects.</p>

You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.But it aint about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward. How much you can take, and keep moving forward. <br>Thats how winning is done!"<br>-Rocky Balboa
